# Jekyll Auth

*A simple way to use Github OAuth to serve a protected jekyll site to your GitHub organization*

## The problem

[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) are awesome, right? Static site, lighting fast, everything versioned in Git. What else could you ask for?

But what if you only want to share that site with a select number of people? Before, you were SOL. Now, simply host the site on a free, [Heroku](http://heroku.com) Dyno, and whenever someone tries to access it, it will oauth them against GitHub, and make sure they're a member of your Organization. Pretty cool, huh?

## Requirements

1. A GitHub account (one per user)
2. A GitHub Organization (of which members will have access to the Jekyll site)
3. A GitHub Application (You can always [register one](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) for free)
4. A heroku account

## Getting Started

### Create a GitHub Application

1. Navigate to [the GitHub app registration page](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. Give your app a name
3. Tell GitHub the URL you want the app to eventually live at
4. The Callback Url is your apps's URL + `/auth/github/callback`
5. Hit Save, but leave the page open, you'll need some of the information in a moment

### Add Jekyll Oauth to your site

#### Copy/Paste

To setup your site to work with Heroku, simply copy the contents of this repository (sans `readme.md`) over to your existing (or new) Jekyll site. If you've got an existing `_config.yml` file, you'll want to merge this repository's `exclude` values with your own to avoid any conflicts.

#### The Git Way

The fastest way (although potentially slightly more complex) to add Jekyll Auth to your site is to run the following command from your project directory (assuming it's already in Git):

```
git remote add jekyll-auth https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-auth && git pull jekyll-auth master
```
### Configuring Heroku

You'll need to tell Heroku a bit about yourself. You can find these on [your application page](https://github.com/settings/applications).

#### The easy way

Run the command `script/setup` from your project's root director. Jekyll Auth will run you through everything you need to set up your site with Jekyll Auth.

#### The manual way

First:

`heroku config:set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=[your github app client id]`

then:

`heroku config:set GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=[your github app client secret]`

finally do one (or both) of these 2 options:

* `heroku config:set GITHUB_ORG_ID=[org id]`
* `heroku config:set GITHUB_TEAM_ID=[team id]`

Where `[org id]` is the *name* of your organization, just like in the URL and `[team id]` is an integer (found in the URL when looking at the team)

### Did it work?

You should be asked to authenticate, and then see your site's content. If this is a new site, check out `/jekyll-auth-test.html`, which should let you see if Jekyll Auth is working correctly.

## Running locally

Want to run it locally? `./script/` is here to help!

1. `script/bootstrap`
2. Configure as above, except use `EXPORT` rather than `heroku config:set`
3. `script/server --auth` for an authenticated site, or just `script/server` for plain-Jane Jekyll

*note:* For sanity sake, and to avoid problems with your callback URL you may want to have two apps, one with a local oauth callback, and one for production if you're going to be testing auth locally.

## Under the hood

Every time you push to Heroku, we take advantage of the fact that Heroku automatically runs the `rake assets:precompile` command (normally used for Rails sites) to build our Jekyll site and store it statically, just like GitHub pages would.

Anytime a request comes in for a page, we run it through [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) (using the `_site` folder as the static file folder, just as `public` would be normally), and authenticate it using [sinatra_auth_github](https://github.com/atmos/sinatra_auth_github).

If they're in the org, they get the page. Otherwise, all they ever get is [the bouncer](http://octodex.github.com/bouncer/).
