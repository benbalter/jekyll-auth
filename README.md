# Jekyll Auth

*A simple way to use GitHub OAuth to serve a protected Jekyll site to your GitHub organization*

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-auth.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-auth) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benbalter/jekyll-auth.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benbalter/jekyll-auth)

## The problem

[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) are awesome, right? Static site, lightning fast, everything versioned in Git. What else could you ask for?

But what if you only want to share that site with a select number of people? Before, you were SOL. Now, simply host the site on a free, [Heroku](http://heroku.com) Dyno, and whenever someone tries to access it, it will Oauth them against GitHub, and make sure they're a member of your Organization. Pretty cool, huh?

## Requirements

1. A GitHub account (one per user)
2. A GitHub Organization (of which members will have access to the Jekyll site)
3. A GitHub Application (you can [register one](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) for free)
4. A Heroku account (you can technically use this elsewhere, but the instructions are for Heroku)

## Getting Started

### Create a GitHub Application

1. Navigate to [the GitHub app registration page](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. Give your app a name
3. Tell GitHub the URL you want the app to eventually live at. If using a free Heroku account, this will be something like <http://my-site.herokuapp.com>
4. Specify the callback URL; should be like this: <https://my-site.herokuapp.com/auth/github/callback>; note that this is **https**, not http.
5. Hit Save, but leave the page open, you'll need some of the information in a moment

Remember the 'my-site' part for later on when using `heroku create`. Also, my-site is often called 'app-name' in Heroku documentation.

### Add Jekyll Auth to your site

1. Within your new site repository or orphaned github [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/) (the branch could be named anything except 'gh-pages' since this would then be public on GitHub!), add `gem 'jekyll-auth'` to your `Gemfile` or if you don't already have a `Gemfile`, create a file called `Gemfile` in the root of your site's repository with the following content:

   ```ruby
   source "https://rubygems.org"

   gem 'jekyll-auth'
   ```

2. `cd` into your project's directory and run `bundle install`. If you get an error using `bundle install`, see Troubleshooting below. 

3. Run `bundle exec jekyll-auth new` which will copy the necessary files to set up the server

### Setting up hosting with Heroku

#### Automatically

Run `bundle exec jekyll-auth setup --client_id XXX --client_secret XXX --org_name XXX`

(or `--team_id XXX`)

#### Manually

1. You may need to add and commit the files generated by `jekyll-auth new` to Git before continuing
2. Make sure you have [the Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed
3. Run `heroku create my-site` from your site's directory; make sure my-site matches what you specified in the GitHub application registration above.
4. `heroku config:set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=XXX GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX GITHUB_ORG_NAME=XXX` (or `GITHUB_TEAM_ID`)
5. `git push heroku`, or if you are maintaining the site in an orphaned branch of your GitHub repo (say 'heroku-pages'), do `git push heroku heroku-pages:master`
6. `heroku open` to open the site in your browser

#### Find the Organization ID (needed to find Team ID)

If you need to find an organization's ID, you can use the following cURL command:

```
curl https://api.github.com/orgs/{org_name}
```

#### Finding the Team ID

If you need help finding a team's numeric ID, you can use the `jekyll-auth team_id` command.

For example, to find the team ID for @jekyll/maintainers you'd run the command:

```
jekyll-auth team_id --org jekyll --team maintainers
```

You'll want to add a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) to your `.env` file so that Jekyll-Auth can make the necessary API request, but the command will run you through the process if you do not provide this.

## Configuration

### Whitelisting

Don't want to require authentication for every part of your site? Fine! Add a whitelist to your Jekyll's **config.yml** file:

```yaml
jekyll_auth:
  whitelist:
    - drafts?
```

`jekyll_auth.whitelist` takes an array of regular expressions as strings. The default auth behavior checks (and blocks) against root (`/`). Any path defined in the whitelist won't require authentication on your site.

What if you want to go the other way, and unauthenticate the entire site *except* for certain portions? You can define some regex magic for that:

```yaml
jekyll_auth:
  whitelist:
    - "^((?!draft).)*$"
```

There is also a more [extensive article containing installation instructions for Jekyll-Auth](http://fabian-kostadinov.github.io/2014/11/13/installation-of-jekyll-auth/) and a second one on [how to find your GitHub team ID](http://fabian-kostadinov.github.io/2015/01/16/how-to-find-a-github-team-id/).

### Requiring SSL

If [you've got SSL set up](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint), simply add the following your your `_config.yml` file to ensure SSL is enforced.

```yaml
jekyll_auth:
  ssl: true
```

### Using a custom 404

Just like GitHub Pages, Jekyll Auth will honor a custom 404 page, if it's generated as `/404.html` in the built site.

## Running locally

Want to run it locally?

### Without authentication

Just run `jekyll serve` as you would normally.

### With authentication

1. `export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=[your github app client id]`
2. `export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=[your github app client secret]`
3. `export GITHUB_ORG_NAME=[org name]` or `export GITHUB_TEAM_ID=[team id]` or `export GITHUB_TEAM_IDS=1234,5678`
4. `jekyll-auth serve`

*Pro-tip #1:* For sanity's sake, and to avoid problems with your callback URL, you may want to have two apps, one with a local Oauth callback, and one for production if you're going to be testing auth locally.

*Pro-tip #2*: Jekyll Auth supports [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) out of the box. You can create a `.env` file in the root of site and add your configuration variables there. It's ignored by `.gitignore` if you use `jekyll-auth new`, but be sure not to accidentally commit your `.env` file. Here's what your `.env` file might look like:

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=qwertyuiop0001
GITHUB_TEAM_ID=12345
```

## Under the hood

Every time you push to Heroku, we take advantage of the fact that Heroku automatically runs the `rake assets:precompile` command (normally used for Rails sites) to build our Jekyll site and store it statically, just like GitHub pages would.

Anytime a request comes in for a page, we run it through [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) (using the `_site` folder as the static file folder, just as `public` would be normally), and authenticate it using [sinatra\_auth\_github](https://github.com/atmos/sinatra_auth_github).

If they're in the org, they get the page. Otherwise, all they ever get is [the bouncer](http://octodex.github.com/bouncer/).

## Upgrading from Jekyll Auth &lt; 0.1.0

1. `cd` to your project directory
2. `rm config.ru`
3. `rm Procfile`
4. Remove any Jekyll Auth specific requirements from your `Gemfile`
5. Follow [the instructions above](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-auth#add-jekyll-auth-to-your-site) to get started
6. When prompted, select "n" if Heroku is already set up

## Troubleshooting

* **ERROR: YOUR SITE COULD NOT BE BUILT** during install, either locally or on Heroku. You likely need to add `exclude: [vendor]` to `_config.yml` in your branch's root directory (create the file if it does not exist already). If you still have problems on the *local* install, you may have better luck using `bundle install --deployment`, but be sure to add the resulting 'vendor' directory to .gitignore. For completeness, the full error may look something like this:


```
remote:        Configuration file: none
remote:                     ERROR: YOUR SITE COULD NOT BE BUILT:
remote:                            ------------------------------------
remote:                            Invalid date '0000-00-00': Post '/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.0.0/gems/jekyll-2.5.3/lib/site_template/_posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown.erb' does not have a valid date in the filename.
```

* **Pushing to heroku**. If you are working from a new GitHub-cloned repo (where you have not run `heroku create`), you may also want to push to Heroku. Instead of adding the remote in the standard way with Git, do this: 


```
heroku git:remote -a my-site 
```
